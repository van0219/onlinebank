	<h5>(We are the World)</h5>
	<p>There comes a time</p>
	<p>When we heed a certain call</p>
	<p>When the world must come together as one</p>
	<p>There are people dying</p>
	<p>Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life</p>
	<p>The greatest gift of all</p>
	<p>We can't go on</p>
	<p>Pretending day-by-day</p>
	<p>That someone, somewhere soon make a change</p>
	<p>We're all a part of God's great big family</p>
	<p>And the truth, you know, love is all we need</p>
	<p>We are the world</p>
	<p>We are the children</p>
	<p>We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving</p>
	<p>There's a choice we're making</p>
	<p>We're saving our own lives</p>
	<p>It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me</p>
	<p>Oh, send them your heart</p>
	<p>So they know that someone cares</p>
	<p>And their lives will be stronger and free</p>
	<p>As God has shown us by turning stones to bread</p>
	<p>And so we all must lend a helping hand</p>
	<p>We are the world</p>
	<p>We are the children</p>
	<p>We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving</p>
	<p>Oh, there's a choice we're making</p>
	<p>We're saving our own live</p>
	<p>It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me</p>
	<p>When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all</p>
	<p>But if you just believe there's no way we can fall</p>
	<p>Well, well, well, well let us realize</p>
	<p>Oh, that a change can only come</p>
	<p>When we stand together as one, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
	<p>We are the world</p>
