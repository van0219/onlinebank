HOW TO USE:

1.  Open "INSTRUCTIONS&DATABASE" folder to read the instructions and get the copy of the db.
2.  Move this folder (OnlineBank) to htdocs.
3.  Open Xampp, start Apache and Mysql.
4.  Import "banking_db". I use HeidiSQL to manage my database. PHPmyadmin is also applicable.
5.  Open your web browser, I have tested Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox only.
6.  Every user login (except admin) requires OTP validation. Therefore, every user must have a mobile number to proceed with the registration. (For staff and account holders only)
7.  The database has previously encoded registrations, please ignore them because the mobile number registered is mine.
8.  The main page is http://localhost/onlinebank/main.php. This is where the account holders(customers) log in. (Create one first in the admin page)
9.  If you want to navigate to the admin page, just type http://localhost/onlinebank/admin_login.php.
10. ADMIN ----  Username is "van0219"  ----  Password is "0219admin".
11. Bank Personnel(s) are bank tellers or other staff, Bank Account(s) are customers.
12. Please note your passwords because the system does not save the actual encoded passwords.
13. If you want to log in as Bank Personnel, go to http://localhost/onlinebank/empLogin.php.
14. I use Globe Sms API to connect the system and the user through short message service.
15. Globe/Connect folder has pre-defined usable php codes inside. I only use the Sms.php, Base.php, and Curl.php. The other codes are used in other
mobile services.
